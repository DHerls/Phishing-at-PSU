			<p>My name is Dan Herlihy and I am a freshman who will hopefully double major in Computer Science and Security & Risk Analysis.  This website was created as part of an advocacy project for CAS 138T.  I had the idea to create a project like this when I was watching the UPUA elections and watching people sign into their accounts on random people's computers.  I realized how easy it would be for someone to steal accounts in that manner and so I decided to dedicate my advocacy project to raising awareness of phishing and identity theft.  My professor in this class is Ben Henderson in the CAS department, and I personally can be reached for comments and questions at <a href="mailto:phishingawareness@psu.edu">phishingawareness@psu.edu</a>.</p>

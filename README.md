# Phishing-at-PSU
This website was built as an advocacy project for CAS 138T at Penn State in order to raise awareness for phishing schemes and identity theft.  The goal is that this will encourage both individuals to be more skeptical of websites online and the University to enact stronger anti-phishing measures.
